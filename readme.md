Simple python script to solve wordle

All you need is to download wordle-helper.py and five_letter_words.txt

> python wordle-helper.py

1. input all the characters that show up in green in the correct order. If a spot on the board is not green (aka its black or yellow), enter _
2. Enter the yellow letters, the letters the word contains but are not in the correct position
3. Enter all the letters that have been blacked out on the keyboard

Script will give you a list of words that meet these 3 criteria. I just enter the first in the list, but you could enter a word further down the find list if you're feeling lucky
